# apt_upgrade_type controls the upgrade strategy for APT systems.
# - 'safe': runs 'apt-get upgrade' (does not remove packages; upgrades only when no new packages/removals are required).
# - 'full': runs 'apt-get dist-upgrade'/'full-upgrade' (may install/remove packages to satisfy new dependencies; handles kernel/meta-package transitions).

# Prevent service restarts (like Docker) during upgrade using policy-rc.d

# Run dpkg --configure -a before upgrading to fix half-configured packages

# Optionally run apt-get -f install before upgrade to fix broken deps
